All what you need to know to start a startup
=======

Hello!

I like to be an entrepreneur and start a spartup *(like you)*. I am happy that I have found content that helped me to understand **what are investors looking for**. Also I am happy to meet people who help me to do my first steps on this way. So, lets start.

Start from Pitch Deck
-------

**Pitch Deck** is a presentation for investors. Main goals are:
- answer **what your project do** and **what differences from your competitors**
- how do you **make money** on your product and **how big is your target market**

Selected content to help you in understanding goals of Pitch Deck:
