We prefer to save our time when create new statup.


### What do we use?

*(We describe why we decide to select each technology - just follow the link)*

 - **Python** - because it's language with beautiful syntax
 - **Flask** - because it's minimalistic web framework
 - **PostgreSQL** - because it's like MySQL but also has support of array columns and JSON fields
 - **RabbitMQ + Celery** - because we need to update some information as deferred tasks
 - **Twitter Bootstrap** - to help us to create first project prototype in minutes
