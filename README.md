Startup sceleton based on Python, Flask and Twitter Bootstrap
=======

Project based on:
 - **Python** - because it's language with beautiful syntax
 - **Flask** - because it's minimalistic web framework
 - **PostgreSQL** - because it's like MySQL but also has support of array columns and JSON fields
 - **RabbitMQ + Celery** - because we need to update some information as deferred tasks
 - **Twitter Bootstrap** - to help us to create first project prototype in minutes
